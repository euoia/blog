So I decided to make a standalone version\nthat runs inside iTerm2.</p>\n<p>Running Neovim this way is great because it leverages the power and stability\nof iTerm2. iTerm2 has great support for customization of appearance and\nkeyboard rebinding.</p>\n<p>Here’s how to build a standalone version of Neovim that’s based on iTerm2.</p>\n<p>I am not a developer of Mac applications, so the following is based on a bit of\ntrial and error and fiddling around with XCode. This is the method I’ve used to\nbuild a standalone version of Neovim several times across several versions of\nNeovim and XCode.</p>\n<p>These steps have been tested with XCode 11.2.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Clone iTerm2 master from GitHub <a href=\"https://github.com/gnachman/iTerm2\">https://github.com/gnachman/iTerm2</a></li>\n<li>Open XCode and choose “Open another project…“. Select the directory where you cloned iTerm2.</li>\n<li>Change Bundle ID to (something like) co.uk.cloudship.neovim</li>\n<li>Under Signing &#x26; Capabilities change to “Sign to run locally”</li>\n<li>In the right-hand pane change Name to Neovim</li>\n</ol>\n<p>A window will appear helping you rename all instances of iTerm2 to Neovim.</p>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li>Update the icons.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Find Supporting Files > Images > Media.xcassets (you can use the filter at the\nbottom of the file list window)</p>\n<p>Grab the Neovim icon from here:\n<a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neovim/neovim.github.io/master/logos/neovim-mark.png\">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neovim/neovim.github.io/master/logos/neovim-mark.png</a></p>\n<p>I used Iconfly to generate AppIcon.appiconset (select generate without scaling).</p>\n<p>Drag the AppIcon.appiconset folder to Xterm.</p>\n<p>Remove the old icon set and rename the new one to the old name.</p>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li>I tried building at this point but it failed due to a reference somewhere to iTerm2.pch.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I couldn’t find where it was in the XCode interface so I opened a terminal and\nsearched inside files:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">iTerm2|master⚡ ⇒ ag iTerm2.pch\nNeovim.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj\n14379:                          GCC_PREFIX_HEADER = sources/iTerm2.pch;\n14434:                          GCC_PREFIX_HEADER = sources/iTerm2.pch;\n14499:                          GCC_PREFIX_HEADER = sources/iTerm2.pch;\n14553:                          GCC_PREFIX_HEADER = sources/iTerm2.pch;</code></pre></div>\n<p>I ran a command to change references to iTerm2.pch to Neovim.pch:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">iTerm2|master⚡ ⇒ find . -type f -exec gsed -i &quot;s/iTerm2.pch/Neovim.pch/&quot; {} \\;</code></pre></div>\n<p>At this point XCode will recognize that the files on disk have changed. You\nshould select the “Revert” option, which loads the project from the files in\nthe disk.</p>\n<ol start=\"8\">\n<li>Build the application by hitting ⌘-R.</li>\n<li>Copy Neovim to applications.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Under Products right click on Neovim.app and select “Show in Finder”.</p>\n<p>Move Neovim.app to applications.</p>\n<ol start=\"10\">\n<li>All done!</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You should be able to run Neovim.app now.</p>\n<p>What I did after this was create a separate profile for Neovim in iTerm2 that\nruns the following at startup: <code class=\"language-text\">nvim &amp;&amp; exit</code>. This option is under Profiles >\nGeneral as “send text at start) in the iTerm2 (and now Neovim) preferences.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Neovim Dot App","date":"November 13, 2019","description":"Creating a standalone Neovim application."}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2019-11-13-neovim-dot-app/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/neovim-dot-app/2019-11-13-neovim-dot-app/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Neovim Dot App"}},"next":null}}}
