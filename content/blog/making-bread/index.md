### Loaf

Made in the morning.

* 500g Strong White Bread Flour
* 21g Salt
* ¾ tsp Allisons dried instant easy bake yeast
* 250g 40C water
* All of the poolish

1. Add the water to the poolish to loosen it from the sides of the bowl and scrape it into the flour mixture.
1. Keeping a bowl of water nearby to wet your hands, mix the ingredients with your hands by folding and pinching alternately for about 3 minutes, until the ingredients are integrated and there is no apparent dry flour. The dough will be very shaggy.
1. Stretch and fold every 30 minutes for the first 90 minutes.
1. Leave for a further hour.
1. Put dough on floured surface and cut in half. Shape each half into boules and place them seam side down into floured bannetons or floured towel lined bowl.
